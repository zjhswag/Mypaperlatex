Text detection and recognition in natural scenes have made significant progress with the development of deep learning, but challenges remain due to complex backgrounds and diverse text shapes. The key issues that need to be addressed include: first, text scale inconsistency and distortion caused by distance and angle; second, poor recognition performance of low-quality text due to background interference, low image resolution, and occlusion; third, the difficulty in accurately detecting and recognizing arbitrary-shaped text, leading to false positives, missed detections, and recognition challenges. This dissertation investigates deep learning algorithms for text detection and recognition in natural scenes, utilizing visual language features and reinforcement learning techniques to enhance text detection and recognition performance. The main work and contributions of this dissertation are summarized as follows:

(1) For the problem of inconsistent text scales and varied shapes in natural scene images, this dissertation introduce a multi-path dynamic fusion text detection model that integrates a scale estimation module. Initially, deformable attention mechanisms are employed to refine feature representations. Subsequently, the scale estimation module assesses and assigns weights to feature maps from different receptive fields, enhancing the model's ability to detect texts at multiple scales. To accurately locate text bounding boxes, a hierarchical feature fusion strategy is adopted, significantly improving the precision of text boundary localization. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of this proposed method.

(2) To tackle recognition issues in low-quality images with occlusions or blurriness, this dissertation propose a visual Language random sequence decoding text recognition model. This approach effectively extracts text features and positional information using visual features. These preliminary visual cues are then fed into a Transformer-based processing module for further exploration of deeper semantic text features. At the decoding stage, an innovative random sequence decoding scheme is adopted, allowing the model to selectively recognize characters based on their quality. Multiple comparative experiments on various natural scene text datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of this proposed recognition method.

(3) Addressing the challenge of detecting and recognizing arbitrary-shaped texts, this dissertation put forward an end-to-end text detection and recognition model based on reinforcement learning. A feature fusion module is utilized to integrate multi-level feature information, thereby enhancing the detector's understanding of complex text layouts. This dissertation construct a bounding box adjustment deep Q-network that can automatically adjust the position and size of bounding boxes under the guidance of text recognition feedback, ensuring precise detection for dense and arbitrarily-shaped texts. Moreover, this dissertation optimize the training methodology for ground-truth bounding boxes to further improve the performance of the end-to-end scene text recognition model. Finally, through experimental comparisons with mainstream methods, our proposed framework demonstrates substantial performance improvements in both text detection and recognition tasks.
